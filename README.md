# Local LLM Installation Guide

This guide is about setting up Large Language Models (LLMs) on older computers and smartphones. I'm learning how to do this and sharing everything as I go. The goal is for everyone to get a chance to play with AI, no matter how much tech knowledge they have.

## Why Am I Doing This?

AI is moving fast. It feels like trying to take a sip from a firehose. It can be hard to catch up if you're not already in the loop. I started this to help people like me, who are curious about AI but don't know where to start. I'm figuring things out one step at a time and sharing what I learn so you can follow along.

## Why GitHub?

I picked GitHub for this project because I want to learn how to use it. It's a great place for sharing code and working together, but it can also be a bit intimidating if you're new to tech. By putting my guide here, I hope you'll see that technology isn't just for experts and that you can learn a lot by diving in and trying things out yourself.

## What's My Approach?

Keeping it simple, starting with the basics. This isn't just about getting AI to work on your computer. It's about understanding what AI is and how we can use it. Here’s what I plan to focus on:

- **Making AI Less Scary**: I'm breaking down the big ideas into small, easy pieces.
- **Learning Together**: I'm not an expert, but I'm learning and sharing everything openly.
- **Thinking About What AI Means**: As we learn, let's think about how AI affects our lives and the world.

## How to Support This Project

This project is about sharing what I learn with you. If you like what I'm doing and want to see more, here are some ways to support:

- **Sponsorship**: Any contribution can go a long way in helping me learn and share more.
- **Sharing**: Tell others about this guide. The more, the merrier.
- **Joining In**: Your questions and feedback make this even better.

Thanks for checking this out. I hope you'll stick around and learn with me. We’re in this together, and I'm excited to see where we go from here.

## A Bit About Me

It’s just me here, no big team or tech background. I’m learning right alongside you, navigating through the world of AI with more enthusiasm than expertise. My journey into this started from sheer curiosity and a bit of a “why not?” attitude.

Why share this? I want you to know that everything here is from someone who’s probably not all that different from you. If I can start wrapping my head around AI and even get it running on my old gear, you can too. This guide is proof that you don’t need to be a tech pro to jump into something new and exciting.

For now, it’s just me behind the scenes, but who knows? As this project grows, maybe there’ll be more folks joining the adventure. Until then, let’s keep learning and exploring together.
